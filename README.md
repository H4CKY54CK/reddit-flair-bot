# reddit-flair-bot
 Handles PM-based user flair assignment for /r/MemoryDefrag.

# More Info
 This script is specific to the subreddit /r/MemoryDefrag. You could adapt it for your own subreddit, but if you're knowledgeable enough to do that, then you are probably able to write your own, making this a bit useless to you. I put this in a repo mainly as a backup and/or for reference.

 This bot is intended to be ran as a service on a Raspberry Pi, so that crashes (which are rare) aren't a problem.

 It should be noted that this script is compact, and not necessarily easy to read. There was no particular goal in mind, other than to have a working flairbot. Also, as a fun side-goal, I've made it a point to keep this bot 50 lines of code or less. Read at your own risk.
